These data provide valuable, real-time insights into a person\u2019s lifestyle, behaviors, and physiological patterns, supporting early detection, remote monitoring, and more informed clinical decision-making. Despite this, most PGHD remains isolated in vendor-specific silos and is not semantically integrated into clinical workflows or EHRs. Examples of such silos include Garmin Connect, Fitbit Cloud, Apple Health Kit, Samsung Health, and Google Fit. Each of these platforms captures data using proprietary formats and data models that differ not only in structure but also in clinical relevance and interoperability capabilities. As a result, integrating PGHD into health systems for primary or secondary purposes is challenging due to the lack of semantic consistency, structural standardization, and interoperability support.</p> <p>Different health information systems tend to prioritize different data standards based on their goals: openEHR: suited for detailed clinical modeling and longitudinal storage, FHIR: focuses on real-time data exchange and interoperability, *OMOP: tailored for harmonized secondary data analysis and research.</p> <p>However, a significant gap exists: there is no common approach to model PGHD once, and then use that model intelligently across multiple standards and use cases. This project seeks to address this gap by using openEHR as the foundation for conceptual modeling of core PGHD elements (e.g., activity, sleep, heart rate, steps). The modeled concepts will then be semantically transformed into FHIR and OMOP using AI-assisted mapping techniques. This transformation enables meaningful reuse and integration of PGHD, whether for clinical care, personal health tracking, or population-level analysis.</p> <p>A joint initiative grounded in openEHR efforts aims to foster collaboration between standards such as FHIR or OMOP. Ultimately, beyond publishing a finalized model for integrating PGHD into the openEHR framework, this work seeks to improve the usability of PGHD across healthcare systems, reduce duplication in modeling efforts across standards, and enhance clinical decision support, continuity of care, and secondary data use. As a prototyping effort, the method developed may also be adapted for other concepts in the future.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About the Project","text":"<p>Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) represents a rapidly growing class of health information that offers unique perspectives on individuals\u2019 health beyond clinical encounters. These data, often collected via wearables and mobile devices, provide rich context for personalized care. Despite their growing clinical and research value, PGHD are rarely structured or standardized in a way that allows for direct integration into Personal Electronic Health Records (EHRs) or clinical decision-making systems.  This project introduces a novel approach to modeling core PGHD concepts using openEHR's dual-model architecture as a foundation. By identifying and analyzing the data blocks and structural units that constitute PGHD (such as activity, sleep, heart rate), the project aims to semantically model them once in openEHR. These models will then be intelligently transformed into FHIR resources and OMOP CDM entities using AI-based semantic mapping techniques.</p> <p>This strategy supports a unified, reusable model for PGHD that can bridge the gap between standards and use cases, whether the goal is primary care integration (via openEHR or FHIR standards) or secondary data analysis (via OMOP). Leveraging openEHR\u2019s strong semantic expressiveness and alignment with clinical thinking, this work proposes a scalable pathway for standardizing PGHD and facilitating its joint utilization across ecosystems.</p>"},{"location":"aims/","title":"Overall Aim","text":"<p>Develop conceptual models for core Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) using openEHR\u2019s archetype-based modeling framework, and to assess the feasibility of semantic mapping to existing structures in HL7 FHIR and OMOP CDM \u2014 identifying gaps and proposing standard extensions where necessary.</p>"},{"location":"aims/#specific-objectives","title":"Specific Objectives","text":"<ul> <li>To identify and select a representative set of PGHD concepts (e.g., step count, heart rate, sleep episodes) that are commonly captured by wearable devices and relevant for integration into personal health records.</li> <li>To develop one or more openEHR archetypes and templates that formally model the selected PGHD concepts using the Archetype Designer and consistent with international modeling guidelines.</li> <li>To implement Python-based scripts that semantically analyze and map the created openEHR structures to existing HL7 FHIR resources and OMOP CDM tables.</li> <li>To evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the mappings and identify structural or semantic gaps where existing standards do not adequately represent the PGHD concepts.</li> <li>To formulate and document proposals for extensions to the FHIR and OMOP standards (e.g., a new FHIR resource, new OMOP concept) to support the modeled PGHD concepts where necessary.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"documents/","title":"This page covers the following topics:","text":"<ul> <li>Identification and modelling of key PGHD concepts using openEHR\u2019s dual-model approach</li> <li>Design or reuse of archetypes and templates via CKM and openEHR tools</li> <li>Semantic mapping analysis with FHIR and OMOP standards</li> <li>Evaluation of existing tools and resources for cross-standard alignment</li> <li>Use of lightweight AI methods (e.g., NLP) to support mapping suggestions</li> <li>Documentation and publication of outputs in open repositories</li> <li>Community feedback and engagement with openEHR and interoperability experts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reports/","title":"The final report of the deliverable will be published and will include reports on the following:","text":"<ul> <li>A set of new and/or adapted openEHR archetypes and templates</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Focused on core PGHD concepts</p> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Created or refined using Archetype Designer and Template Designer</p> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Shared via CKM or GitHub with appropriate metadata</p> <ul> <li>A mapping report and comparative analysis</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Documenting semantic alignments and gaps between the developed openEHR models and equivalent representations in FHIR and OMOP</p> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Including terminology mapping tables and alignment justifications</p> <ul> <li>Evaluation summary of existing transformation tools</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Review and assessment of available openEHR\u2013FHIR/OMOP mapping resources and utilities</p> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Recommendations for reuse, limitations, and future integration potential</p> <ul> <li>A structured technical report or short research article</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Outlining the methodology, modelling approach, and key findings</p> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Suitable for submission to a digital health, standards, or informatics journal or conference</p> <ul> <li>Educational and documentation materials</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Presentation slides and written guides explaining the modelling and mapping process</p> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Targeted at newcomers to PGHD modelling and cross-standard interoperability</p> <ul> <li>Contribution to community resources</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Submission of archetypes to the openEHR CKM for review</p> <p>\u00a0\u2013 Sharing insights or feedback to relevant working groups (e.g., openEHR Discourse)</p>"}]}
