## The Beginning — Before the Fellowship

> “This journey began with a simple question.”

During one of the lectures I was giving on openEHR modeling, I was explaining the
distinction between **Observation** and **Evaluation** when I suddenly paused.
The whiteboard was half-covered with diagrams, the students were waiting for me to
continue, but something shifted.

Without planning to, I asked:

> **“How do we record life in data?  
> Not just illness.  
> How do we capture the quiet signals of the body?”**

The room fell silent — not the silence of confusion, but the silence of a new idea forming.
I did not realize it yet, but this was the beginning of the path I am still walking.

As I continued working with archetypes, I found myself drawn to examine:

- what already exists,
- what is missing,
- and what should be expressed more clearly.

At the same time, I was collaborating with students on an openEHR modeling project.  
We worked through design, modeling, evaluation, revision — a shared thinking process.

Later, I noticed increasing discussions in the openEHR community regarding physical activity
and wearable-generated health data:

Meanwhile, broader global initiatives were exploring similar directions:

## Reflection

I now recognize that this fellowship did not start my journey — it simply made visible what was already unfolding.  
The central question is still guiding me:

> **How do we create space in the health record for life — not only illness?**

Not to answer it once and for all,  
but to keep walking with it.
