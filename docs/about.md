# 📘 About the Project

Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) represents a rapidly growing class of health information that offers unique perspectives on individuals’ health **beyond clinical encounters**. These data, often collected via **wearables** and **mobile devices**, provide rich context for **personalized care**.

Despite their growing value in clinical and research settings, most PGHD are:
- Not **semantically structured**
- Not **standardized**
- Difficult to integrate into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) or clinical decision systems

## 🧠 Project Innovation

This project introduces a **novel modeling approach** using openEHR’s dual-model architecture as a foundation.  

PGHD concepts will be semantically modeled once in openEHR and then  we will evaluate automatically transformed into:
- 🔁 **FHIR resources**
- 📊 **OMOP CDM entities**
Transformation is enabled through AI-assisted semantic mapping techniques.

## 🔗 Why This Matters

This strategy enables:
- ✅ A **unified, reusable model** for PGHD  
- 🔄 Bridging the gap between **primary care standards** (openEHR, FHIR) and **secondary analysis frameworks** (OMOP)  
- 🚀 A scalable and clinically aligned path to structure, share, and use PGHD across the health ecosystem
---

## 💬 Summary

Leveraging openEHR’s strong semantic capabilities and alignment with clinical logic, this project proposes a future-ready solution to transform how we capture and use Patient-Generated Health Data.
