# Overall Aim

Develop conceptual models for core Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) using openEHR’s archetype-based modeling framework, and to assess the feasibility of semantic mapping to existing structures in HL7 FHIR and OMOP CDM — identifying gaps and proposing standard extensions where necessary.

# Specific Objectives

* To identify and select a representative set of PGHD concepts (e.g., step count, heart rate, sleep episodes) that are commonly captured by wearable devices and relevant for integration into personal health records.
* To develop one or more openEHR archetypes and templates that formally model the selected PGHD concepts using the Archetype Designer and consistent with international modeling guidelines.
* To implement Python-based scripts that semantically analyze and map the created openEHR structures to existing HL7 FHIR resources and OMOP CDM tables.
* To evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the mappings and identify structural or semantic gaps where existing standards do not adequately represent the PGHD concepts.
* To formulate and document proposals for extensions to the FHIR and OMOP standards (e.g., a new FHIR resource, new OMOP concept) to support the modeled PGHD concepts where necessary.
