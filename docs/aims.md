# 🎓 Overall Aim

To develop conceptual models for core **Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD)** using the **openEHR dual-model architecture**, and to assess the feasibility of semantic transformation into **HL7 FHIR** and **OMOP CDM** — identifying interoperability gaps and proposing necessary standard extensions.

---

# 📌 Specific Objectives

- 🧭 **Scoping**: Select representative PGHD concepts (e.g., step count, heart rate, sleep episodes) commonly captured by wearable devices and relevant for personal health record integration.

- 🧩 **Modeling**: Design openEHR **archetypes and templates** for these concepts using Archetype Designer, aligned with international modeling principles.

- 🧬 **Semantic Mapping**: Implement lightweight Python scripts to analyze and **map** openEHR models to existing HL7 FHIR resources and OMOP CDM tables.

- 🧪 **Gap Analysis**: Assess mapping **completeness and accuracy**; identify where FHIR or OMOP structures fall short.

- 🛠️ **Standards Enhancement**: Document and propose extensions (e.g., new FHIR profiles or OMOP domains) to support PGHD more effectively.
