# üéì openEHR Fellowship Project
Welcome to the official documentation of **Somayeh Abedian's Fellowship Project**!

## üéØ Project Main Goal
To develop conceptual models for key **Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD)** using openEHR‚Äôs archetype-based modeling framework, and to:
- Assess semantic mapping feasibility to HL7 FHIR and OMOP CDM
- Identify gaps
- Propose extensions to existing standards where needed

## üß† Project Background
**Why PGHD matters:**  
Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD)‚Äîlike data from wearables, mobile health apps, and home sensors‚Äîis becoming central to:
- Personalized & preventive care
- Remote monitoring
- Early detection
- Data-driven clinical decision-making

However, much of this data remains **siloed** and not interoperable.

**Examples of PGHD silos:**
- Garmin Connect
- Fitbit Cloud
- Apple Health Kit
- Samsung Health
- Google Fit

Each uses proprietary formats with inconsistent structure** and limited semantic alignment, making integration with clinical systems difficult.

## üß¨ Health Data Standards: A Quick Comparison
Different health information systems prioritize different data standards based on their goals:
- **openEHR**: suited for detailed clinical modeling and longitudinal storage
- **FHIR**: focuses on real-time data exchange and interoperability
- **OMOP**: tailored for harmonized secondary data analysis and research

## üß© Bridging the Gap
**The problem:**  
There is no unified method to model PGHD once and reuse it across multiple standards and use cases.

**This project aims to:**
- Use openEHR for primary conceptual modeling of PGHD elements (e.g., activity, sleep, heart rate, steps)
- Apply AI-assisted transformation to map those models to FHIR and OMOP
- Enable semantic reuse across clinical care, personal health apps, and research

## ü§ù Collaboration and Future Vision
This initiative supports stronger **alignment** between standards like openEHR, FHIR, and OMOP.  
The outcome is a **reusable, extensible model** of PGHD that:
- Reduces modeling duplication
- Enhances clinical decision support
- Enables better secondary use of health data
- Can be extended to other concepts beyond PGHD in the future
